# Apache Reverse Proxy Configuration for IServ Remote Desktop
# This configuration handles WebSocket proxying and SSL termination for the application
#
# IMPORTANT: Replace ALL occurrences of 'your-domain.com' with your actual domain name
# IMPORTANT: Update SSL certificate paths to point to your actual certificate files

# Enable required Apache modules:
# sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http proxy_wstunnel rewrite ssl headers

    # WebSocket support - CRITICAL for noVNC
    # For WebSocket connections, we need to ensure the Upgrade and Connection headers
    # are passed through to Flask. We use RewriteRule to detect WebSocket upgrades
    # and pass them to Flask unchanged, allowing gevent-websocket to handle them.
    
    # Note: We do NOT use ProxyPass with upgrade=websocket because:
    # 1. It would make Apache handle the WebSocket upgrade itself
    # 2. Flask needs to inspect the Referer and session headers for routing
    # 3. gevent-websocket needs to see the original WebSocket upgrade request
    
    RewriteEngine On
    
    # Pass WebSocket upgrade requests to Flask unchanged
    # The [P] flag makes Apache proxy the request
    # The [L] flag makes this the last rule if it matches
    # Note: Using =websocket for exact match to avoid false positives
    # Connection header check is more flexible to handle comma-separated values
